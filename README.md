# Customer_Satisfaction_Prediction_using_ANN
This project is a Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) Prediction System that uses deep learning to estimate how satisfied a customer is likely to be based on various customer service and product-related details. It involves building an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model using TensorFlow and deploying it through a Streamlit web application for real-time predictions. The dataset used contains different factors like channel of communication, issue category, sub-category, manager name, agent shift, tenure, customer remarks, response time, product category, and customer city, along with the CSAT score (ranging from 0 to 5). The data is first preprocessed by encoding all categorical variables into numeric form using label encoding so that they can be used by the neural network. Then, the dataset is split into training and testing sets, ensuring 80% of the data is used for training and 20% for testing. To make the model learn efficiently, feature scaling is applied using standardization, which brings all numerical values to a similar range. The ANN model is built with three hidden layers containing 128, 64, and 32 neurons respectively, each using ReLU activation for non-linearity, and dropout layers are added to prevent overfitting. The output layer has a single neuron with linear activation to predict a continuous CSAT score. The model is compiled with the Adamax optimizer, mean squared error as the loss function, and mean absolute error as a metric. It is trained over 300 epochs using mini-batches, with a validation split to monitor performance and prevent overfitting. Once trained, the model is evaluated on test data to calculate MSE and MAE, which show how accurate and consistent the predictions are. A line plot is generated to compare training and validation loss over epochs, visually showing how the model improves during learning. After achieving satisfactory results, the trained model is saved in Keras format for future use in the Streamlit app.

The Streamlit web app provides a user-friendly interface for predicting CSAT scores interactively. It has a clean layout with a title and a customizable background image to improve appearance. The app collects user input through dropdown menus and number inputs for all key factors such as communication channel, category, sub-category, manager, tenure, shift, product category, response time, and customer city. Once the user provides input and clicks the “Predict CSAT Score” button, the app uses the pre-trained ANN model to predict the satisfaction score. In this version, the input to the model is represented by placeholder random data, but in future updates, it can be replaced with actual encoded values to provide accurate predictions. The predicted score is restricted between 0 and 5 to ensure realistic output. The result is displayed in a visually appealing way with both the numeric CSAT score and a star rating representation, where full stars indicate the integer part and a sparkling star symbolizes a partial rating.

The overall system demonstrates how machine learning and AI can be applied to customer analytics. It allows businesses to understand customer satisfaction drivers, monitor service quality, and improve performance. The entire workflow—from loading and cleaning data to training a neural network and deploying a web-based interface—forms a complete AI pipeline. The technologies used include Pandas and NumPy for data handling, Scikit-learn for preprocessing, TensorFlow/Keras for model building, Matplotlib for visualization, and Streamlit for deployment. Possible future enhancements include encoding real user inputs for accurate predictions, adding automated sentiment analysis of customer remarks, implementing retraining pipelines for updated data, visualizing feature importance for interpretability, and deploying the app online using Streamlit Cloud or Hugging Face Spaces. Overall, this project provides a practical example of building an end-to-end customer satisfaction prediction model that is both analytical and interactive, helping organizations make data-driven decisions to enhance user experience and service quality.
